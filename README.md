This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The repository contains all necessary scripts and configuration files to build, test, and deploy a machine learning model using Python.

### Features

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation and validation
- Saving and loading trained models
- Deployment using a web API (Flask)
- Example usage and test cases

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd mlproject-main
  ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **Run the training pipeline:**
  ```bash
  python src/train.py
  ```

4. **Start the API server:**
  ```bash
  python src/app.py
  ```

### Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code for data processing, model training, and deployment
